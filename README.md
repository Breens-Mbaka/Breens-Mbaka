**Hi there** 👋🏻

## About Me 😁
* 📱 Android Developer

* 🔭 I’m currently working on Anime Follow a place to search for new animes & mangas while recommending them to your friends

* 🌱 I’m currently learning how to write unit tests and Test Driven Development

* I share Insights, Apps, and my Android development journey in my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BreensR).

* 🎥  I also do occassionally create tutorials on Modern Android Development on my Youtube channel and some of the side projects I've built [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyPt1hX4foGlNPBGoVpEDUw/videos).

* 😁 When I get a great PC I would love to stream on Twitch creating my side-projects in public. My inspiration mainly comes from problems I face personally or that I come across or what my friends & family face(fingers crossed)
